# mAIstermind
The aim of this project is to train and test differents sub-symbolic systems capable to play the mastermind board game. To do this, this repository contains: 
- Players that implement different mathematical strategies to play the game and build the training database 
- Neural networks implemented using Tensorflow Estimators 
- Jupyter notebooks to manage the databases 
- Jupyter notebooks to analyze the neural networks performances
